If you have written many functions, it would be more convenient to build up a package. It is also wonderful to share the tools you created by developing a R package. I will introduce some easy steps to achieve this goal.

## Preparation

We need to creat a project for the new package.

### Creat a new project

Click these butthons in your Rstudio.

`File > New project > New Dictionary > R package`

Then you need to edit the `DESCRIPTION` file.

 \fbox{
Package: Example
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license is it under?
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
}

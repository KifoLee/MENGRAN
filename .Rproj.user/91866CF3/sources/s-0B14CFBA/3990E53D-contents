My research focuses on **extreme value theory**, **spatial-temporal modeling**, and **causal inference**, especially application in climate change. I also have an interest in **R programming**. 

Currently, my research topic is to derive and study probabilities of necessary and sufficient causation of extreme events using sub-asymptotic models under the framework of the counterfactual theory. The models are usually more realistic in capturing extreme dependence on environmental processes and they will be used to assess human influence over heat waves and extreme precipitation at different places around the globe. 

I will share some knowledge and technology here. But I will often leave articles unfinished (and won't complete, perhaps). Also, I will regard it as a notebook. 

My resume is available in [html](/resume/) and [PDF](/resume/index.pdf) form.

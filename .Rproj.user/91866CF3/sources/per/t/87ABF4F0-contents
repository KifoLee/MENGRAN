In practice, we always find the function in a published R package can not meet our needs very well. However, it's not necessary to write a new function all over. It would be more convenient if we can modify the function directly. Let's look at an example.

We check the source code of <code>sd()</code> function in the <code>stats</code> package. The source code is as following:

```{r , comment=""}
library(stats)
sd
```

You can edit this function via <code>trace("function name", edit = TRUE)</code> directly in this window displays automatically as you like and save it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trace("sd",edit=TRUE)
```

You won't change the code in the published package but you can use the modified code locally until you reload the package.

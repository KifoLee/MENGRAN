This website is established by R Blogdown. So the first article here is to introduce how to build it by R Blogdown.

## R and R Studio
Of course you need a R. R Studio IDE is not necessary, as you can use command in R directly.  
But I think R Studio can reduce your confusing greatly, especially for those who are not proficient in programming.

You can download [R](<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>) and [R Studio](https://www.baidu.com/link?url=wvLDPhdBNMS_sRtEAVnbAh1fvhypiu4zgSc_xjpTC00u4CJLxtlUElh7GhKDoYpScTUcMbnRwJ5MyOY_UauPEq&wd=&eqid=dedd20a80013a2a6000000025fd6bfed) here.

## Blogdown and HUGO
The second step is installing the $blogdown$ package. You can use the following command in R:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```


And install HUGO:


```{r,eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```


If error appears, you can use $devtools$:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```

## Github

Sign in [Github](https://github.com/) and download the [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Build Web

Creat a new project in your R Studio:

You can name you project and set a hugo theme. The default theme is Yihui's lithium, which is simple and clean. You can select one theme that you like in [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). And click on the $download$ button:

Then you will see its github home. Get the address after $http://github.com/$ in your browser's address bar:

 Click on the $Create$ $Project$ button. Just wait. Then you will success.

## Asymptotic Model

### Formula

$$M_n=max\{X_1,\dots,X_n\}$$

where $X_1,\dots,X_n$, is a sequence of independent random variables having a common distribution function $F$.


Since $F$ is unknown, so we can look for approximate families of models for $F^n$.


$$\begin{align}
  x^2  + y^2 & = 1                      \\
 x         & = \sqrt{1-y^2}
\end{align}$$

<p>Many fantastic things can be done in R. A beautiful resume or CV can leave a good impression of you to others. People usually make their resume or CV in word. HTML is also an extraordinary typesetting tool, which is one of the motivations Yihui created a series packages about html. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about HTML or CSS. You are able to write a beautiful resume or CV in R easily.</p>
<div id="resume-in-pagedown" class="section level2">
<h2>Resume in pagedown</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you need to do is install the <code>pagedown</code> package.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&#39;rstudio/pagedown&#39;)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a rmarkdown file</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="resume.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the content as you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple resume is completed by this way. Isn’t it?</p>
<div id="costume-your-resume" class="section level3">
<h3>Costume your resume</h3>
<p>You may want to modify the icon, color, font or any other details. For the icon, for example, you’ like another icon to replace the suitcase icon <i class="fa fa-suitcase"></i> .
The original code is <code>{data-icon=suitcase}</code>. All you need to do is to search a new icon in <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&amp;p=2">fontawesome</a> and paste its name like <code>{data-icon=user-circle}</code>. Then it displays as <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i>.</p>
<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.2/css/all.css"></link></p>
<p>If you want to change the font size, color etc, you may know a little css.</p>
<p>The book <a href="https://pagedown.rbind.io/#the-css-overriding-mechanism">pagedown: Create Paged HTML Documents for Printing from R Markdown</a> has a simple explain on css in Chapter 2.2. You need to change your css file.</p>
<p>Simply, first, add or change css file in the yaml. Second, define your class. Third, use the new class in your document.</p>

<div id="pdf-version" class="section level3">
<h3>Pdf version</h3>
<p>We need a pdf version in many occasion. So you should delete the # in front of <code>#knit: pagedown::chrome_print</code>. Then you will knit a pdf file.</p>
<p>Sometimes it fails because R can not find the chrome. If so, run this line in your R console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.setenv(PAGEDOWN_CHROME  = &quot;url&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><code>url</code> is the position of your chrome.exe.</p>

<div id="cv" class="section level2">
<h2>CV</h2>
<p>Another idea is to generate the content via table, which can have a tidy output through <code>kable</code>.</p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/MengranLi-git/CV">project</a> to write personal CV, especially the template is for phd application. But you can download and costume it as your own purpose.</p>
<p>You can manage your own data and update the CV easily. And the css document is more clear so that you can change it more continently.</p>
